### Learning Objectives

- Distinguish what is Big Data (volume, velocity, variety), and will learn where it comes from, and what are the key challenges
- Determine how and where Big Data challenges arise in a number of domains, including social media, transportation, finance, and medicine
- Investigate multicore challenges and how to engineer around them
- Explore the relational model, SQL, and capabilities of new relational systems in terms of scalability and performance
- Understand the capabilities of NoSQL systems, their capabilities and pitfalls, and how the NewSQL movement addresses these issues
- Learn how to maximize the MapReduce programming model: What are its benefits, how it compares to relational systems, and new developments that improve its performance and robustness
- Learn why building secure Big Data systems is so hard and survey recent techniques that help; including learning direct processing on encrypted data, information flow control, auditing, and replay
- Discover user interfaces for Big Data and what makes building them difficult
- Measure the need for and understand how to create sublinear time algorithms
- Manage the development of data compression algorithms
